Before, in high school, when I heard of AI and machine learning, not only did I not understand what it was and what was meant by the terms, I had no idea that we would get to the point that were at today, much less in a few years. I am so interested in our ability to use computers in this way and am very excited to see what this course has to offer. As a student looking to enter the workforce soon, I know these will be useful skills.\n",
